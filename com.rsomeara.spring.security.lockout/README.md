# Chronicler

GitHub integration which validates release note/change log updates occur

Features in progress:

- Specify groups of files which coorespond to a release note file which should be updated when they change (including ability to exclude files patterns from that group)
- Specify if the check MUST pass (required) for a PR to be merged (Travis is "required", CodeCov is not)
- Allowing collaborators (push access) to override status check failure with a comment mentioning the integration
